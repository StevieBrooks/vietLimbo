# vietLimbo
A website I'm making for my wife.

With any luck, Viet Limbo is going to be one of the go-to websites for learning about Vietnamese language and culture. My wife is a teacher of Vietnamese and I want to learn her language so my plan is to use my programming skills to create a bunch of resources that will aid in my learning.
