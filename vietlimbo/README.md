# Welcome to the Viet Limbo repo

This website is for a client of mine in Vietnam who teaches Vietnamese for a living. Initially, the project was only meant to be a website for her to showcase her services. However, we have since made an agreement to continually add resources aimed at helping learners with their Vietnamese.

Check out the website using the [link](https://vietlimbo.com/) and feel free to use any of the tools on the site.
