            <img src="vLPics/5.jpg" alt="">
            <p>As Viet Limbo is still in its infancy, please don't be surprised or demotivated if a few teething problems occur. My husband and I are hard at work
                to build a unique and valuable ensemble of resources to aid you learn Vietnamese. As you may be aware already, Vietnamese pronunciation is no easy feat.
                So I would like to invite you to check out the resources tab in the main menu. The Viet Limbo team - well, my hubby and I - have put together some vocal
                cards to help you master the correct pronunciation of the Vietnamese alphabet.

            <p>My husband is currently training to be a software developer and as his skillset grows, so will the complexity and value of this site. It is our humble

                I would be more than delighted to hear them. For now, please remember that learning this melifluous language is not a sprint, it's a marathon. Take your time
                and I hope you enjoy this journey as much as I do. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Your friend and Vietnamese mentor, Lily.

            <h2 class="title">Viet Limbo <br>Testimonials to Wet Your Whistle</h2>
            <p>My husband is the skeptical type, especially when it comes to websites he’s never seen before. 
                After all, how difficult is it to write an overzealous review from an alleged student? He 
                contends that it’s as easy as making toast. Therefore, for your reassurance, you can 
                verify all of these testimonials on Verbalplanet, one of the platforms where I freelance.</p>

            <p class="sec-info">The first lesson is always free. Besides, it's more of an informal chat than anything else, 
                so charging wouldn't be proper. That being said, one of the objectives of these get-to-know 
                sessions is that you leave with something, even if it's just one new word. I sincerely look 
                forward to working with you.
